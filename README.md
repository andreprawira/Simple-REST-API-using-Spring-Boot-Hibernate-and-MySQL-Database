# Simple-REST-API-using-Spring-Boot-Hibernate-and-MySQL-Database
 It's a very simple REST API for employee management using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL.  Test it with Postman:  Use GET method to list all of the employees or a single employee specified by ID Use POST method to save an employee (ID auto generated) or use a PUT method to update if employee ID already exist (specify the employee ID in the url to update) Use DELETE method to delete an employee (specify the employee ID in the url to delete) Dont forget to change the application.properties to connect the database with the app (located in src/main/resources/application.properties)
